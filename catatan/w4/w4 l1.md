# Pattern Recognition in Computer Vision

## Pattern Recognition

### Introduction
- **Definition**: Pattern recognition aims to automatically identify patterns and regularities in data.
- **Examples**:
  - Object recognition (e.g., image classification)
  - Text classification (e.g., spam filtering)
  - Speech recognition (e.g., automatic subtitling)
  - Event detection (e.g., surveillance)
  - Recommender systems (e.g., webshops)

### Pattern Recognition Categories
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning patterns with available labels (ground truth).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering patterns without labels.
- **Semi-supervised Learning**: Using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.
- **Weakly Supervised Learning**: Utilizing noisy or imprecise labels.

### Applications in Computer Vision
- **Image Content Decisions**: Analyzing and classifying image content.
- **Character Recognition**
- **Human Activity Recognition**
- **Face Detection/Recognition**
- **Image-based Medical Diagnosis**
- **Biometric Authentication**

## Pattern Recognition Systems

### Basic Stages
- **Image Acquisition**
- **Pre-processing**: Enhance images for further processing.
- **Feature Extraction**: Measure certain properties to reduce data.
- **Feature Selection**: Retain the most descriptive features.
- **Learning System**
- **System Evaluation (Testing)**

### Concepts
- **Objects**: Physical entities captured in images.
- **Regions**: Areas corresponding to objects post-segmentation.
- **Classes**: Groups of objects with common features.
- **Labels**: Indicators of object class membership.
- **Classification**: Assigning labels based on features.
- **Classifiers**: Algorithms performing classification.
- **Patterns**: Regularities used by classifiers.

## Feature Representation and Extraction

### Feature Vector Representation
- **Definition**: Vector \\( \\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d] \\), where each \\( x_j \\) is a feature.
- **Examples**:
  - Fish recognition: [length, color, lightness, ...]
  - Letter/digit recognition: [holes, moments, SIFT, ...]

### Feature Extraction
- **Goals**: 
  - Ensure similarity for objects in the same category.
  - Distinguish objects in different categories.
- **Properties**:
  - Invariant to translation, rotation, and other transformations.
  - Robust against occlusions and illumination variations.

## Supervised Learning

### Overview
- **Function**: \\( f \\in F: X \\rightarrow Y \\)
- **Training Set**: \\( \\{ (x_i, y_i) \\in X, Y \\} \\)
- **Learning Goal**: Find \\( f \\) such that \\( y_i \\approx f(x_i) \\)

### Models
- **Generative Models**:
  - Model data generation mechanisms.
  - Represent classes by probabilistic models \\( p(x|y) \\) and \\( p(y) \\).
  - Useful for unsupervised tasks.
- **Discriminative Models**:
  - Focus on decision boundary modeling.
  - Applicable to supervised tasks.

### Classification
- **Process**: Assign class labels based on features.
- **Challenges**: 
  - Variability in feature values.
  - Noisy and missing features.

### Nearest Class Mean Classifier
- **Training**: Calculate centroids for each class.
- **Testing**: Classify based on distance to centroids.
- **Pros and Cons**: 
  - Simple and fast but struggles with complex classes and noise.

### K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
- **Process**: Classify based on the majority of K nearest neighbors.
- **Pros and Cons**:
  - Simple and intuitive but can be slow and struggles with high dimensionality.

### Bayesian Decision Theory
- **Concept**: Use probabilities for soft decisions.
- **Decision Rule**: Classify based on the highest posterior probability.
- **Pros and Cons**: 
  - Intuitive and considers uncertainties but computationally expensive.

### Decision Trees
- **Structure**: Nodes represent features; leaf nodes contain class labels.
- **Construction**: Based on questions guiding to class labels.
- **Pros and Cons**:
  - Easy to interpret but can overfit and only handle axis-aligned splits.

## Ensemble Learning

### Random Forests
- **Concept**: Ensemble of decision trees.
- **Training**: Randomly sample data and features to construct trees.
- **Pros and Cons**:
  - High accuracy and handles large datasets but less interpretable than single trees.
